<!--This page will explain the symptoms and the different types of Cerebral Palsy in various list-->
<h3>Symptoms of Cerebral Palsy</h3>
<p>Some of the symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delays in reaching motor skills milestones, such as sitting up or crawling</li>
<li>Favoring one side of the body, such as only reaching with one hand or dragging a leg while crawling</li>
<li>Excessive drooling or problems with swallowing</li>
<li>Difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils</li>
<li>Variations in muscle tone, such as being either too stiff or too floppy</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Types of Cerebral Palsy</h3>
    <br>
    <u><h4>What is Spastic Cerebral Palsy</h4> </u>
<p> Spastic CP affects 80% of people with CP. People with spastic CP have increased muscle tone. This means their muscles are stiff and, as a result, their movements can be awkward. Spastic CP usually is described by what parts of the body are affected:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Spastic diplegia/diparesis</em> (Little's Disease) is when muscle stiffness is mainly in the legs, with the arms less affected or not affected at all. People with spastic diplegia might have difficulty walking because tight hip and leg muscles cause their legs to pull together, turn inward, and cross at the knees.</li> <br>
<li><em>Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis</em> only affects one side of a person's body; usually the arm is more affected than the leg.</li> <br>
<li><em>Spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis</em> is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all four limbs, the trunk, and the face. People with spastic quadriparesis usually cannot walk and often have other developmental disabilities such as intellectual disability; seizures; or problems with vision, hearing, or speech.</li>
</ul>

    <u><h4>Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy</h4> </u>
<p> Dyskinetic CP affects people's movements more specific controlling their hands, feet, arms and legs, this makes it difficult when sitting and walking. These movements are uncontrollable and can be slow and writhing or rapid and jerky. Sometimes the face and tongue are affected and the person has a hard time sucking, swallowing, and talking. A person with dyskinetic has muscle tone that can vary meaning that muscles can become too loose or too tight on a daliy basis.</p>

    <u><h4>Ataxic Cerebral Palsy</h4></u>
<p> Ataxic CP is when someone has difficulty with balance and coordination. They might be unsteady when walking, or have problems with quick movements. Movements that require lots of control such as writing can be difficult. They can also have problems with there hands, and arms when reaching for something. </p>

<!--<h3>Mixed Cerebral Palsy</h3>
<p>Mixed CP is when someone has syptoms of more than one type of CP, this type of Cerebral Palsy is called spastic-dyskinetic CP.</p>-->
