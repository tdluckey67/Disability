 <h3>Discovery of Cerebral Palsy</h3>
        
<p>When Cerebral Palsy was first discovered in the mid 1800s by William Little, the name was called Little's disease. Little begun his study on cerebral palsy in 1830, he was lecturing about birth injures. It was in 1860 that Little's work officially defined CP as "abnormal forms of labor that which the child has partially suffocated injures of the nervous system and results in spastic rigidity and sometimes paralytic contraction." Little's study is now defined as one of the four types of CP. </p>
