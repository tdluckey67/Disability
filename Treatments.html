<h2>Treatments</h2>
<!--The purpose of this code is to display many different Treatments-->
<p>There are various treatments availible for CP from birth to adulthood which include:</p>
       <u> <h4>Medications</h4></u>
<p>Medications that can lessen muscle tightness might be used to improve functional abilites, treat pain and manage complications related to spasticity or other cerebral palsy symptoms.</p> 

<ul>
<li><b>Muscle or nerve injections.</b> To treat tightening of a specific muscle, your doctor might recommend injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), or another agent. The injections will need to be repeated about every three months.</li>

Side effects can include pain at the injection site and mild flu-like symptoms. Other more-serious side effects include difficulty breathing and swallowing.

<li><b>Oral muscle relaxants.</b> Drugs such as baclofen, tizanidine (Zanaflex), diazepam (Valium) or dantrolene (Dantrium) are often used to relax muscles.</li>

In some cases, baclofen is pumped into the spinal cord with a tube (intrathecal baclofen). The pump is surgically implanted under the skin of the abdomen.

<li><b>Medications to reduce drooling.</b> One option is Botox injections into the salivary glands.</li>
</ul>
<u> <h4> Therapies </h4> </u>
<p>Even though I am listing only two types of therapies their are many more available<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Physical therapy.</b> Muscle training and exercises can help your child's strength, flexibility, balance, motor development and mobility. You'll also learn how to safely care for your child's everyday needs at home, such as bathing and feeding your child. Your therapist can provide guidance on how you can continue muscle training and exercise at home between therapy visits.</li>

For the first 1 to 2 years after birth, both physical and occupational therapists work on issues such as head and trunk control, rolling, and grasping. Later, both types of therapists are involved in wheelchair assessments.

Braces, splints or other supportive devices might be recommended for your child to help with function, such as improved walking, and stretching stiff muscles.

<li><b>Recreational therapy.</b> Some children benefit from regular or adaptive recreational or competitive sports, such as therapeutic horseback riding or skiing. This type of therapy can help improve your child's motor skills, speech and emotional well-being. Both adults and children benefit from regular physical activity and exercise for general health and fitness.</li>

    <u><h4>Surgical procedures</h4> </u>
<p> Surgery may be needed to lessen muscle tightness or correct bone abnormalities caused by spasticity. These treatments include:</p>

<li><b>Orthopedic surgery</b> Children with severe contractures or deformities might need surgery on bones or joints to place their arms, spine, hips or legs in their correct positions. Surgical procedures can also lengthen muscles and lengthen or reposition tendons that are shortened by contractures. These corrections can lessen pain and improve mobility. The procedures can also make it easier to use a walker, braces or crutches.</li>
<li><b>Cutting nerve fibers (selective dorsal rhizotomy)</b> In some severe cases, when other treatments haven't helped, surgeons might cut the nerves serving specific spastic muscles in a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy. This relaxes the muscle in the legs and reduces pain, but can cause numbness.</li>
        </ul>
