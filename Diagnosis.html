<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<!--The purpose of this code is to display the different ways doctors diagnose Cerebral Palsy-->
<p>Many people may wonder how doctors diagnose CP, here some ways doctor detect various types of CP.</p>
<h2>1. Brain Scans</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cerebral-palsy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354005">Mayo Clinic</a> Doctors use brain-imaging technologies to reveal areas of damage or abnormal development in the brain. These tests might include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)</em> which uses  radio waves and a magnetic field to produce detailed 3D or cross-sectional images of the brain. An MRI is painless, however it's noisy and can take up to an hour to complete. Children will more than likely recieve a sedative or light general anesthesia beforehand.</li>
<li><em>Cranial ultrasound</em> uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the brain. An ultrasound doesn't produce a detailed image, but it may be used because it's quick and it can provide a valuable preliminary assessment of the brain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Electroencephalogram</h2>
<p> An Electroencephalogram is used, to detect the cause of seizurezes. An electroencephalogram or EEG is a series of electrodes are attached to a child's scalp. The EEG records the electrical activity of the child's brain.</p>
<h2>3. Laboratory tests</h2>
<p>Tests of the blood,urine or skin might be used to screen for genetic or metabolic problems.</p>
